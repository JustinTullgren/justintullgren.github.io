### The Ask

Given a class `Meeting` which has `startTime` and `endTime` integer fields, write a function to merge the meetings so that it is
possible to see when there are no active meetings.  

The `startTime` and `endTime` represent thirty minute blocks of time passed 9:00AM.  

For example: `Meeting(0, 2)` is a 1 hour meeting starting at 9:00AM.

**Do not assume the meetings are in order**.

### The Example

Given the following meetings:

```
  [Meeting(0, 1), Meeting(3, 5), Meeting(4, 8), Meeting(10, 12), Meeting(9, 10)]
```

Then the result should be:

```
  [Meeting(0, 1), Meeting(3, 8), Meeting(9, 12)]
```

### Thought Process

The bolded _assumption_ statement clarifying the items are not sorted made me want to sort the items right away. However, having not thought
about the problem more in depth I took a note to think about that after reviewing the problem more.  

I scanned the meetings in the example and tried to pick up on what my brain was doing automatically, which ended up being looking for the lowest 
start time followed by the max end time that did not skip the last max end time. 

#### Sort

I therefore _did_ choose to sort the meetings by `startTime`.  
I generally prefer to be safe and not modify inputs but in this example I did modify the input in place. If there is no space constraint
I would take the safe approach instead.

```kotlin
data class Meeting(val startTime: Int, val endTime: Int)

fun mergeMeetings(allMeetings: MutableList<Meeting>): List<Meeting> {
  allMeetings.sortBy { it.startTime }
}
```

#### Merge Range

Thinking of the meeting _range_ made me think of a _min_ and a _max_. Now that the meetings are sorted I made the starting range be the first meeting
`startTime` and `endTime`.

```kotlin
var min = allMeetings[0].startTime
var max = allMeetings[0].endTime
```

### Guard

Seeing the index access of the meetings list made me pause and think about an empty list or having only one meeting.  In either case we 
don't need to do anything and we can prevent an index out of bounds error by returning early.

```kotlin
fun mergeMeetings(allMeetings: MutableList<Meeting>): List<Meeting> {
  if (allMeetings.size <= 1) return allMeetings
  
  allMeetings.sortBy { it.startTime }
}
```

### Merge

Next was to find the overlapping _and adjacent_ meetings to form our meeting ranges.  The _adjacent_ piece matters because we are merging a range and
having ranges next to each other does not help us solve the use case.  Additionally, since we started with a range using the first item in the sorted
list we don't need to process it.

```kotlin
fun mergeMeetings(allMeetings: MutableList<Meeting>): List<Meeting> {
    if (allMeetings.size <= 1) return allMeetings
  
    allMeetings.sortBy { it.startTime }
    
    var min = allMeetings[0].startTime
    var max = allMeetings[0].endTime
    
    var mergedMeetings = mutableListOf<Meeting>()
    
    // meeting 0 already processed, start with next
    for(i in 1 until allMeetings.size) {
        val meeting = allMeetings[i]
        
        if (meeting.startTime > max) {
            // this range is completed, add to final list
            mergedMeetings.add(Meeting(min, max))
            
            // start next range
            min = meeting.startTime
            max = meeting.endTime
            
            continue
        }
        
        if (meeting.endTime >= max) {
            // increase range
            max = meeting.endTime
        }
    }
    
    // when the loop finishes we have not added the last range, add it.
    mergedMeetings.add(Meeting(min, max))
    
    return mergedMeetings
}
```

### Closing Thoughts

The final function runtime s `O(n log n)` due to the comparison based sorting.  The final space is `O(x)` which is the number of meeting ranges
after the merge/reduction.  This is because we sorted the the input in place so there is no additional space we are using.  If I were being safe and 
creating a new list to sort it would be `O(n + x)` to create the new list to sort and the reduced final list.

### Follow up

There were some edge cases such as when the first meeting starts first and ends last that resulted in more meetings than there should be in the resulting
list. I also wanted to look at it using a more fluent api with a touch of functional programming.

```kotlin

data class Meeting(val startTime: Int, var endTime: Int)

fun mergeRanges(meetings: List<Meeting>): List<Meeting> {
    if(meetings.size <= 1) return meetings
    
    val sortedMeetings = meetings
        .sortedBy { it.startTime }
    
    val firstMeeting = sortedMeetings.first()
    
    return sortedMeetings
        .drop(1)
        .fold(mutableListOf(firstMeeting)) { merged, meeting ->
            val lastMeeting = merged.last()
            when {
                meeting.startTime <= lastMeeting.endTime -> {
                    lastMeeting.endTime = 
                        Math.max(lastMeeting.endTime, meeting.endTime)
                }
                meeting.endTime <= lastMeeting.endTime -> {
                    // noop
                }    
                else -> {
                    merged.add(meeting)
                }
            }
            
            merged
        }
}
```
